There are two things to note when let is compared with var in 
this example:

Though the output is expected to be the one defined in the scope, 
it means the value 999 remains in the scope of the condition,
and the value “111” is available only in the scope of the function.

Second, since they are two separate values, both xs can be of different
types. At the moment, we are not explicitly mentioning the type. However,
TypeScript will determine that the former x is a string while the latter 
is a number
