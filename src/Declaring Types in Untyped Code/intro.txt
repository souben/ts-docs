Declaring Types in Untyped Code
The keyword declare can be used before one of the previous 
three declaration types (var, let, const). As the name suggests,
it declares to TypeScript that the variable is somewhere but not
saying where. This is not used frequently but can be useful if 
you need to tell the transpiler that the variable is present,
just not in the current project (or loaded module), and may
not be visible.
